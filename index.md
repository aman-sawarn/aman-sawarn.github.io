## About

<img class="profile-picture" src="20181027_140217.jpg">

I'm a researcher and data scientist working in natural language processing, computational social science, and cultural analytics. I'm interested in modeling how people communicate about their subjective experiences through text, especially when these communications occur in online communities centered on healthcare support or cultural objects like books or games. My research relies on unsupervised machine learning methods and re-explores the reliability and evaluation of these methods when applied to small, topic-focused datasets. 

My past work has examined how postpartum people frame their [birth experiences](https://maria-antoniak.github.io/resources/2019_cscw_birth_stories.pdf),  how people communicate their [pain levels](https://maria-antoniak.github.io/resources/2020_frontiers_pain.pdf) to physicians, and how the use of word embedding models require additional [stability tests](https://maria-antoniak.github.io/resources/2018_evaluating_stability.pdf) when used to measure biases.

I'm currently a working as a Data Scientist at HT Media Ltd. Currently, I work in Shine.com team which is India's second largest recruiting platform.  I have completed my B.Tech in Electrical and Electronics Engineering from Guru Gobind Singh Indraprastha University, New Delhi. 


Natural language processing, unsupervised machine learning, digital humanities, healthcare, computational social science.
