# Ethics for NLP

Other sources .... Alexandra Olteaunu, Data Feminism (Lauren Klein and Catherin D'Ignazio),

## Scope

A lot of this might seem obvious once you know it.

I am not an expert in ethics. I'm a practioner who tries to think hard about why I'm doing what I'm doing and how it affects the people I'm studying.

People in NLP tend not to think about these things... This is written from a very NLP (ACL, EMNLP) perspective. 

Main takeaway - no easy answers and you have to think through all of this on your own, for your project. But there is a ton of prior work and we are NOT in the "wild west" anymore.

## Look at the Data

Actually read through your data. What are the concerns of the people who generated your data>

<br>

## Selecting Examples

Thanks to Emily Bender

<br>

## Paraphrasing

originally saw this in Diyi Yang's paper, comes from prior work ...

<br>

## The Belmont Report

Thanks to Karen

<br>

## Give Back

Thanks to Lana Yarosh

Give back to the community you studied! Share you findings with them! This can be scary, but isn't it the whole point?


<br>

## Arists or Protected?

Thanks to Amy Bruckman article

<br>

## Sharing Data

How to share? When to share?

<br>

## ASK

We're so used to collecting "passive" data that we forget that we can just *ask* the people who generated the data what they think!

<br>

## Open Questions

- Trigger warnings (how to do this properly, warning those who might have trauma, without implying that the subject is icky or taboo)
