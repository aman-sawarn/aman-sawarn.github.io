## About

<img class="profile-picture" src="20210123_165431.jpg">

I'm a data scientist and researcher working in natural language processing, machine learning, statistics and analytics . I'm interested in modeling how people communicate about their subjective experiences through text, especially when these communications occur in online communities centered on healthcare, recruitment, media and advertising or building communities. My research relies on Medical Report Generation using X-Ray Images and topic-focused datasets. 

Previously, I have worked on various projects as self case study during my undergrad. My work on [predicting flairs/tags on Reddit website](https://github.com/aman-sawarn/Reddit-Flair-Detection) aims at predicting tags on a given Reddit link. 
My past work on predicting movies genres aims at solving the problem as [multi-label multi-class problem](https://medium.com/towards-artificial-intelligence/keras-for-multi-label-text-classification-86d194311d0e). My work on a [Fashion Recommendation Engine](https://github.com/aman-sawarn/Amazon-Fashion-Discovery-Engine) where I have worked on Data Fetching from Amazon's website and then building models on top of it.  I have also worked on various neural architectures to predict [Donors who could fund projects for school](https://github.com/aman-sawarn/Donor-Choose-Automation) children. 

My work on Medical Report Generation using X-Ray Images is yet to be published.


I'm currently a working as a Data Scientist at HT Media Ltd. Currently, I work in Shine.com team which is India's second largest recruiting platform.  I have completed my B.Tech in Electrical and Electronics Engineering from Guru Gobind Singh Indraprastha University, New Delhi in June 2020. 


Natural language processing, unsupervised machine learning, digital humanities, healthcare.
